# dev slam

This repository is for me to slowly build out a scratch SLAM system for eventual deployment in [Navie](https://github.com/Nianzu/Navie)

Work on this project is guided by Dr. Kaveh Fathian as part of the Graduate course Robotic Mapping & Localization (CSCI 598B) @ Colorado School of Mines Spring 2024, but all work is my own alone.
